**Question:** How do you create a database named `saturday` and switch to it for further operations?


```sql
-- 1. Create the 'saturday' database and switch to it
CREATE DATABASE saturday;
USE saturday;
```

**Explanation:** The script starts by creating a new database named `saturday` and then switches to that database using the `USE` command. This sets up the environment for further operations, ensuring that all subsequent queries are executed within this database.

**Question:** How do you create a `customer` table with specific columns and designate a primary key?

```sql
-- 2. Create the 'customer' table
CREATE TABLE customer (
    cID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(50),
    phoneNum VARCHAR(15)
);
```

**Explanation:** This query creates a `customer` table with five columns: `cID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `email`, and `phoneNum`. The `cID` column is defined as the primary key, ensuring that each customer has a unique identifier.

**Question:** How do you insert multiple customer records into the `customer` table with specific details like first name, last name, email, and phone number?

```sql
-- 3. Insert values into the 'customer' table
INSERT INTO customer VALUES
(1, 'amit', 'sharma', 'amit.sharma@example.com', '9876543210'),
(2, 'priya', 'mehta', 'priya.mehta@example.com', '8765432109'),
(3, 'rohit', 'kumar', 'rohit.kumar@example.com', '7654321098'),
(4, 'neha', 'verma', 'neha.verma@example.com', '6543210987'),
(5, 'siddharth', 'singh', 'siddharth.singh@example.com', '5432109876'),
(6, 'asha', 'rao', 'asha.rao@example.com', '4321098765');
```

**Explanation:** Six records are inserted into the `customer` table, each with values for `cID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `email`, and `phoneNum`. This populates the table with initial data for further querying.

**Question:** How would you standardize the formatting of first names and last names in the `customer` table by trimming any extra spaces and converting the text to lowercase?

```sql
-- 4. Standardize the formatting of first names and last names in the 'customer' table
UPDATE customer
SET FirstName = LTRIM(RTRIM(LOWER(FirstName))),
    LastName = LTRIM(RTRIM(LOWER(LastName)));
```

**Explanation:** This query standardizes the `FirstName` and `LastName` fields by trimming any leading and trailing spaces and converting all characters to lowercase. The `LTRIM` function removes leading spaces, `RTRIM` removes trailing spaces, and `LOWER` converts the text to lowercase.

**Explanation:** This query retrieves all records from the `customer` table where the `FirstName` starts with the letter 'A'. The `LIKE 'A%'` pattern matches any first name that begins with 'A', followed by any number of characters.

```sql
-- 5. Retrieve all records where the first name starts with the letter 'A'
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%';
```

**Explanation:** This query retrieves all records from the `customer` table where the `FirstName` starts with the letter 'A'. The `LIKE 'A%'` pattern matches any first name that begins with 'A', followed by any number of characters.

**Question:** How can you select all customers from the `customer` table whose phone numbers consist of exactly 10 digits?

```sql
-- 6. Select all customers with 10-digit phone numbers
SELECT * FROM customer 
WHERE phoneNum LIKE '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]';
```

**Explanation:** This query selects all customers from the `customer` table whose phone numbers are exactly 10 digits long. The pattern `LIKE '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'` matches a sequence of 10 digits.

**Question:** How can you find all customers in the `customer` table who have a last name that is exactly 5 characters long?

```sql
-- 7. Find customers with a last name that is exactly 5 characters long
SELECT * FROM customer 
WHERE LastName LIKE '_____'; -- underscore is 5 times
```

**Explanation:** This query finds all customers in the `customer` table who have a last name that is exactly 5 characters long. The pattern `LIKE '_____'` (five underscores) matches any last name with exactly five characters.

## The table shared contains a `RunningTotal` column, which is cumulative sum of the `TotalAmount` for each `CustomerID`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/774f607e-b773-4837-833c-399dce9221d5)

```sql
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    OrderID,
    TotalAmount,
    SUM(TotalAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY OrderID) AS RunningTotal
FROM 
    Orders;
```

**Explanation:**
- `PARTITION BY CustomerID`: This partitions the data by `CustomerID`, ensuring that the running total is calculated separately for each customer.
- `ORDER BY OrderID`: This orders the rows within each partition (i.e., within each customer) by `OrderID` to calculate the running total in the correct sequence.
- `SUM(TotalAmount) OVER (...)`: This computes the cumulative sum of the `TotalAmount` as a running total for each customer.

**Explanation:**
This SQL query calculates the total sales for each customer, ranks them based on those sales in descending order, and displays the customer ID, total sales, and their rank. The ranking is done using the `RANK()` function. The results show customers ordered by their total sales, with the highest sales receiving the highest rank.
