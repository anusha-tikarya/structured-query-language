### Detailed Explanation:

- **Data Warehouse Concepts:** Data Warehouses are critical for storing data in a structured way, enabling businesses to perform deep analysis and generate reports. They have a complex architecture with layers for staging, data integration, and presentation. Unlike Operational Data Stores, which handle real-time data and immediate queries, Data Warehouses focus on historical data and complex queries. Data Marts serve as smaller, more focused warehouses for specific departments.

- **SQL Fundamentals:** SQL is used to manage and manipulate data in databases. Basic operations include inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data. Filtering allows for precise data retrieval, and advanced filtering can include multiple conditions and patterns. Data integrity is crucial, ensuring that the data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable over time.
