### Summary

- **Purpose**: Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
- **Syntax**: Generally follows `function_name() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... ROWS ...)`.
- **Working**: Operates over a window of rows defined by `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `ROWS`.
- **Why Use It?**: To perform advanced analytics and calculations without needing subqueries or complex joins.
- **Exceptions/Mandatory**: Most require an `ORDER BY` clause to define the row order, and some may need `PARTITION BY` or `ROWS` clauses for specific calculations.
